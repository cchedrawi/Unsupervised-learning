# unsupervised-learning
In this project, the primary objective is to analyze the 20 Newsgroups dataset, comprising 18,000 documents across 20 categories. The data undergoes extensive preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and TF-IDF transformation. A focus on similarity measures involves computing cosine similarities and word co-occurrence matrices from a stratified sample of 1000 documents. Clustering is performed using the k-medoids algorithm, followed by dimensionality reduction techniques such as SVD, t-SNE, and UMAP for visualization. The project extends to word embeddings through Word2Vec, exploring differences between t-SNE and UMAP visualizations. Lastly, the utilization of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for sentence generation completes the comprehensive analysis, highlighting the project's multi-faceted approach to text data exploration and modeling.
